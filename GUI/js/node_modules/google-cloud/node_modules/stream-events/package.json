You receive two events `reading` and `writing`-- no magic is performed.\n\nThis works well with [duplexify](https://github.com/mafintosh/duplexify) or lazy streams, so you can wait until you know you're being used as a stream to do something asynchronous, such as fetching an API token.\n\n\n## Use\n```sh\n$ npm install --save stream-events\n```\n```js\nvar stream = require('stream')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar util = require('util')\n\nfunction MyStream() {\n  stream.Duplex.call(this)\n  streamEvents.call(this)\n}\nutil.inherits(MyStream, stream.Duplex)\n\nMyStream.prototype._read = function(chunk) {\n  console.log('_read called as usual')\n  this.push(new Buffer(chunk))\n  this.push(null)\n}\n\nMyStream.prototype._write = function() {\n  console.log('_write called as usual')\n}\n\nvar stream = new MyStream\n\nstream.on('reading', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being asked for data')\n})\n\nstream.on('writing', function() {\n  console.log('stream is being sent data')\n})\n\nstream.pipe(stream)\n```\n\n### Using with Duplexify\n```js\nvar duplexify = require('duplexify')\nvar streamEvents = require('stream-events')\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nvar dup = streamEvents(duplexify())\n\ndup.on('writing', function() {\n  // do something async\n  dup.setWritable(/*writable stream*/)\n})\n\nfs.createReadStream('file').pipe(dup)\n```",
